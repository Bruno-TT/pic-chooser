Got too many old pics?
Tired of going through them and deleting the bad ones?

The solution is easy!
Put all your pictures in images/
Then run the program. Simply press up to keep (moved to like/) or press down to remove (moved to dislike/)

Nothing is permanently deleted, and the filename is printed each time in case you make a mistake.



I wrote this in like 20 minutes but let me know if you find this useful, since it could easily be improved upon.
